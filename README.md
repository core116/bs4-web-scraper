# Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup and Python

This repository contains code on how to build a web scraper with request and Beautiful Soup.
+ The [`PyScrape.ipynb`](https://github.com/MachinatorX/bs4-web-scraper/blob/main/PyScrape.ipynb) is the notebook script highlighting the step of the process.
+ The [`job_search.py`](https://github.com/MachinatorX/bs4-web-scraper/blob/main/job_search.py) is the final code expanded as a command-line interface. This is used to automate the scraping process. The `url` used is `Monster.com`. The code can be run in the command line using 'python job_search.py'.
